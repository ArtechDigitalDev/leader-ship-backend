## Leadership Types

The system determines one of six leadership types based on the highest scoring category:

1. **VISIONARY LEADER** (Clarity highest)
2. **STEADY LEADER** (Consistency highest)
3. **COLLABORATIVE LEADER** (Connection highest)
4. **BOLD LEADER** (Courage highest)
5. **INNOVATIVE LEADER** (Curiosity highest)
6. **INTEGRATED LEADER** (Balanced across all categories)

## Learning Tracks

Each leadership type has three learning tracks, with one recommended based on the growth focus area:

- **STRATEGIC VISION**: Develop skills in long-term planning and purpose-driven leadership
- **SYSTEMS BUILDING**: Create sustainable processes and reliable leadership habits
- **BOUNDARY SETTING**: Learn to set clear expectations while preserving relationships
- **DECISIVE LEADERSHIP**: Build confidence in making tough decisions quickly and effectively
- **DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS**: Master challenging discussions with confidence and clarity
- **MENTORING MASTERY**: Develop advanced skills in developing and scaling others
- **ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION**: Lead large-scale change and cultural evolution
- **PURPOSE EXPLORATION**: Deepen your understanding of personal and organizational purpose

## Integration Notes

- The profile determination uses the same 25-question 5Cs assessment
- Responses should be integers from 1-5 (Likert scale)
- Questions 1-5: Clarity, 6-10: Consistency, 11-15: Connection, 16-20: Courage, 21-25: Curiosity
- Balanced leaders have scores within 3 points of each other across all categories
